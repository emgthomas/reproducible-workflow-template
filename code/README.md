# code

This directory contains all code used in processing and analysis. Code files should have names that reflect the order in which they should be run to replicate the project. For example, you might label your files 0_processing_data.R, 1_analysis.R, 2_tables_and_figures.R, and so on. 

This readme should be used to describe the function of each code file, and any further details needed for another person with knowledge of the relevant programming language(s) to re-run the code.
